     For my activity I did a survey of people to see what the consensus was
     about in-home voice assistants.
   </p>

   <p>
     My first question was: do you or would you own an in-home voice assistant
     (such as Google Home or Amazon Alexa)?
   </p>

   <p>
     My next question was: do you think these devices are listening and
     recording what you say even before you say the activation word?
   </p>

   <p>
     My next question was: do you know who has access to all your data that is
     being stored?
   </p>

   <p>
     My last question was: is it ethical for these companies to always be
     recording with these devices?
   </p>

   <p>
     I asked thirty three students at CSUEB these four questions.
   </p>
   <p>
     20 people said they would or do own a Google Home.
   </p>

   <p>
     18 people said they think the device is always listening.
   </p>

   <p>
     22 people said they dont know who has access to the data these devices aquire.
   </p>

   <p>
     23 people said they think it is unethical for these devices to always be listening.
   </p>

   <p>
     It seems that people think the devices always lsitening is unethical but they would still own one. It is like a necessary evil
     that they are use to that comes witht he devices.
