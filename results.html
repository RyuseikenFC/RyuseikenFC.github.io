   Video Game projects

<div id="myear">
<p>
  In the beginning I got into computer science to make video games. Clearly I think
  there's a little bit of that in everyone that becomes a computer science major.
  But I don't want to work on video games professionally and the stars did not align
  for me to work on some of these ideas for money. Im not with the right company
  and I dont have the right to work with certain IP. My favorite games of all time
  are League of Legends and Kingdom Hearts. Working on those games or with Riot or
  Square Enix would be the dream of a life time but I have accepted that I am not
  growing in the direction that they need to work on their video games. Before I
  went away to college I spent some time with my good highschool friends talking
  about what we would do if we worked on some games. Thats where these ideas come
  from. Pre-Computer science degree with post computer science degree knowledge.

</p>
<p>
  For my software development class I worked in a group of five people to make a
  video game in the Unity game engine. I prefer the Unreal Engine 4 but Unity is
  a big name in game development too. The game utilized a singleton design pattern
  so there is one class that is called one time to manage the entire game. The
  development life cycle was a combination of agile and spiral as we added, removed,
  and modified features of the game as we developed it. The entire game was documented
  in IEEE documents an SRS, an SDS, and test cases. we used Github for version cotnrol.
  This was my first introduction to video game development and I think it went
  off pretty sucessfully. I learned a lot of other useful skills for developing
  software but the leap I made in the unity environment made my ideas for making
  these games a LOT more doable.

<p>
  Kingdom Hearts Idea
</p>
<p>
  Basically I can import pieces of the game into a project and make my own Kingdom
  hearts 3 and then make games 4, 5 and so on. I can cotnrol what happens. Kingdom
  hearts is a good series but the people that own the IP are destroying the idea
  on a number of fronts. The first front is kingdom hearts 1 came out when I was
  in elementry school and kh2 came out when I was in highschool. Now I graduated
  from college and kh3 still isn't out. I have obtained the knowledge to make my
  own kh3 before it has been released so if I want something done I got to do it
  myself. Another is the story line is not fun at all. Riku is a keyblade master
  when Sora isn't even though Riku was once lsot to darkness. The mastry exam is
  a joke, the different time lines of xanort is weird, and the keyblade acadame
  that ventas and aqua go to is weird. Now the story line is messed up and Axel
  and kiri have keyblades and the concept witht he disney princesses of light was
  thrown out the window.
</p>
<p>
  my idea is to use this website https://www.models-resource.com/playstation_2/KingdomHearts/
  to get all the models from the last kingdom hearts games and make my own spin off
  of kingdom hearts games with my friends. Make a new story that focuses on the
  princesses and the origional boss. Incorperate the new cool stuff from the disney
  universe like Naruto, Starwars, Marvel, and even Frozen and Dragon Ball Z.
  Make a new line of villians that want to do something like Kilo Ren, Freeza, galactis
  and Thanos, Madara nad Kabuto. Make all these vilians team up with Xanort to
  conquer the universe with darkness. getting all the modles into one project would
  be easy even extracting terrain and sound effects from other games could be easy.
  doing voice acting and doing animation would be hard. But I could make a better
  story and have cooler game play elements like sora using the force or sage mode
  or getting an ironman suit. And fighting Darth vader or Kilo Ren. The possabilities
  are limitless and I think that is what made kingom hearts 1 and 2 so great.

<p>
  League of legends MMO Idea (maybe VR)
</p>
<p>
  League of legends is my most favorite game I have played since it came out I
  would love to work at Riot doing anything would be a dream come true. Ever since
  I started I like the lore of the characters and the Runaterra Universe. That is
  where this idea comes from the Runaterra Universe. I would like to explore the
  city of Piltover, the Desert of Shurima, the kingdom of Damacia, and the temples
  of Ionia. To do it in VR would be so cool, to look up and see the giant sun disk
  Azir rose would be insane. Most of the land of Runaterra

<p>
  Working With Riot API
</p>
<p>
  this is a smaller project that I has a lot of potential. I can make my own game
  or jsut have a website that rewards players bassed off of items or scores they
  get in a league of legends game. Basically playing league lets a user gain some
  kind of rewards or experience in my game bassed on their in match scores thanks
  to riots api. The concept of using Riots api for this really made me interested
  in how it could be incorperated into soemthing for the user rather than just how
  sites like op.gg and lolking use the API.
