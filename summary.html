   Summary

 <div id="mysum">
<p>
  In-home voice assistants like Google Home and Amazon Alexa are collecting data from people
  that don't care or don't know how this information is used. Most of the people that do know don't care but for the people
  that don't know this data storage is a huge invasion of privacy going on inside their own homes. Such practices
  make it unethical. The stake holders are big companies such as Google and Amazon that
  want the data of the users. Even the
  people that know about these practices and don't want to get the devices are still susceptible to other people
  that do have the devices. By simply walking into a home with a Google Home or an Alexa they are unwittingly
  having themselves recorded.

  As for in-home voice assistants recording environments unknowingly, I think the court case speaks for
   itself. Having a court use a personal in-home voice assistant as evidence is not the future - it is already here.
   Is it ethical for a court to gain access to a personal in-home voice assistant? Right now that decision
   is made for us. Amazon becomes the unexpected witness, and Amazon will testify.
