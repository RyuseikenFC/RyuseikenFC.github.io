<p>
  I am a computer science graduate from California State University East Bay. I
  graduated at the end of the winter quarter in March 2018. I am living in the
  Bay Area and would love to work in San Fransisco someday. I am professionally
  interested in iOS development and full stack web development. I am also
  interested in video game development, Artifical Inteligence (AI), and
  opportunities to learn about cyber security. In school I enjoyed database
  architecture, working with SQL, and setting up and working with database
  schemas. I have spent a lot of time working with HTML and other basic web
  development fundamentals and I have created and worked on 4 iOS apps. My big
  picture idea for the feature is based around the question "what will houses
  in 1,000 years be like." Basically I spend time thinking about what the hosue
  of the future will be like and then how can I work towards it.
  My dad gave me that idea.

  During my time at CSUEB I was a feedback intern for a non-profit organization
  called Start Up East Bay. An organization with the goal to bring resourses to
  students and the community that was based on building busisness. Basically
  taking an idea all the way to a buisness. Start Up East Bay achieved this by
  connecting students and community members with resources to create, grow, and
  participate in a company by holding events and talks. I gained soft skills by
  working in a team to accomplish tasks. I also learned to work with common tools
  like Slack, Trello, Google docs, Google sheets, and Google slides. Updating
  tasks and statuses in Trello was the most new for me but it gave me a good
  experience of using task software in a big group. I feel like going into my
  internship my leading skills were stronger than my team player skills so I
  wanted to work on skills like following others and letting others lead. Early
  in my internship my mentor Jerry taught me that sometimes being a good team
  player means taking small leads sometimes to get tasks done. That was the most
  valuable advice I recieved there.

  On this site I want to document my ideas and experiences I have had. I think
  about projects that aren't really probable for me to think about or work on.
  Some projects are big and require help from a range of creative help to
  technical help.
