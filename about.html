	Meet the Owner: *bio pic*
		Stacey DeMartini turned her hobby of working out into her career during her Undergrad at San Francisco State University for her B.S in Kinesiology.  She grew up playing and coaching competitive fastpitch softball and although knew it wasn’t a forever profession; fell in love with the fitness aspect of it all. She has been around and worked with athletes in different settings such as coaching, physical therapy, and even Athletic Trainers for Stanford’s Football team. She moved from the West Coast to the East Coast to pursue her Masters in Athletic Training at Boston University while concurrently working at Equinox as a Tier 3+ trainer. Stacey always wanted to own her own fitness facility in order to help others better themselves, reach their goals, and build the strength and endurance to conquer anything. She has held her Personal Training Certification from ACE for the past seven years. She also holds certifications in Precision Nutrition, Sports conditioning and nutrition, Certified Functional Strength and Conditioning, Pre/Post Natal, and Kettle Bell Athletics (Level 1).
