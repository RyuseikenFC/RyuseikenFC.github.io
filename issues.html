   iOS development

<div id="myear">
<p>
  I have made two iOS apps and worked on two more iOS projects. The first two
  apps I did on my own during college. California State University East Bay did
  not have an iOS class. They did have an android class in the catalog but never
  offered it. I am familar with java kotlin and android studio enought to make
  an Android app but I have an iPhone and making iOS apps is much more fun. All
  my iOS apps have been written in Swift, in the environment xCode, use coco pods,
  Firebase, and utilize a Model View Controller design (MVC). They have all been
  a single view application. I became a computer scientist because I watned to
  make apps. There are a lot of fundamental classes to become a computer scientist
  so nearly halfway through graduating I could see that if I wanted to make an app
  I would have to do it on my own. Near the same time I had looked into what
  employeers wanted and discovered web development and react so I had switched my
  goal to read more about web development. Soon after my second app I was given
  the opertunity to work on an app for a start up so I was kind of juggeling iOS
  development and web development. Soon after I finsihed my work for the start up
  I worked on an app for my friends company that is basically an app like super cuts
  has. So after I had swithced gears from iOS development to web development I was
  kind of puleld back to it with the opertunities to work with these small companies
  and learn a bit mroe about iOS devlopment. Below is more details about the projects
  I worked on.
<p>
  The Messaging App
</p>
<p>
  This app was the first app I made. I wanted to learn about the basic fundamentals
  of iOS development. How to start up a project, how to connect to a database,
  how to get and set data from that database, and how to do user login. This
  project taught me so much more and I did while I was in school during my free
  time so I didnt have to rush to get anything done I took my time to learn about
  different details of ios development. This taught me the most of any project
  and I had spent the most time on it messing around trying different stuff.
</p>
  <p>
    The Social Media App
  </p>
  <p>
    By the time I started this app I felt like a pro and by the time I had
    finished it I had felt more like a pro. This app set up was similar and had
    the similar featers like user login, connecting to a database, and getting
    and setting data from the database. This app built ontop of what I learned
    from my first app and expanded. This app had a newsfeed developed, a friends
    list, basic profiles, and messaging. I finished this app faster than my
    messaging app and it has more featuers. I felt very good about this app. I
    didnt big test it but all the basic functionality works.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Cleaning app project
  </p>
  <p>
    An opertunity to work with a small start up was posted at my school to make
    an app for a clearning service. I saw it and thouhg maybe its like uber for
    clearnign services. A user would tell the app they need something cleaned and
    the workers would accept the job like uber does. I texted the poster and talked
    to her more and I told her about my apps that I had made and the functionality
    of them and she said that she was looking for something like what my apps could
    do. I told her Id like to make a prototype for her and do her login and hook
    her up to a database. So I started and put the prototype together for her in
    about an hour. She wouldnt tell me what the rest of the app would be like and
    I woudlnt want to design it alone or for free but I got experience making a
    prototype quickly for a customer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Hair cut app project
  </p>
  <p>
    During the time of working on the cleaning app my friend asked for help for
    her friends start up. An app just like super cuts. This peeked my interest. I
    was trying to move on fromt he cleaning app back to web development but this
    hair cut app had something interesting. Google maps that displayed locations
    of the stores. I thouhg today is the day I sit down and learn how to use google
    maps api. The entire time a comptuer science student is in school they think
    about different project they cant do because they don't know about how to
    incorperate google maps intot heir project. But today I was ready to tackle
    the beast. I had no idea how hard or easy it would be. It turnes out one
    tutorial later and a google search for their documentation it is REALLY easy
    to get map functionality into an app. This app is simple. Hook to a database
    search bassed on user location and show a map witht he stores. after the user
    picks a store the user signes up for the line witht heir name and DONE. This
    app was the first time I had used google maps in a project and I'm very happy
    with how easy it turned out to be. My friend helped design the layout of the
    app and how it works but I wrote all the code, got all the functionality to work
    and most importantly got the map to work.
