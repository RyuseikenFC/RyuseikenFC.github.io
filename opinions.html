  <p>
    Personally I do not own any of these devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    Allowing Google or Amazon to listen to everything in my room just so I can easily get the weather is not appealing to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Basically the cost of losing personal privacy and information outweighs the benefits associated with ease of access to shopping, playing music and checking traffic or the weather.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the court case where Amazon Alexa recorded the murder, the accused willingly allowed Amazon to hand over the recordings. In that case I think it is ethical but the idea that Amazon has these
    recordings ready to hand over at their own will is a contentious topic.
  </p>
  <p>
    I do not think that taking advantage of people passively talking is ethical. A person should feel secure in their own home and private life without worrying about
    some anonymous entity listening in.
  </p>
  <p>
    I wish Google and Amazon would leave that out of their products or at least have an opt-in option for those who would accept continual listening or recording.
    For the people that want to know the weather easily, the price they pay to these big companies is that they get to keep the data they want.
    For those that do want continual listening, such as those with severe medical conditions that may need to communicate immediate health concerns,
    the loss of privacy is a price to pay for being continually monitored.
