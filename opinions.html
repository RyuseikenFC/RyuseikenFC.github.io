  I have been playing League of Legends since the game was released. I have been
  platinum since season 4. I have played every single role over the seasons and
  starting in season 6 I stopped playing as much, only get plat and gold on
  other accounts. This last season I played mostly jungle warwick. I played Warwick
  since his rework in season 7. Every game I start top side without a leash and
  solo dragon at level 3. In season 8 the runes got reworked and as of now a lot
  of junglers fell off making ww float to the top and getting pciked and banned a
  lot. Also this season was my last season at College. Last season I got to diamond 5
  in the preseason with warwick. I played one season of Star league for California
  State University Easy Bay.
