     For my activity I did a survey of people to see what the consensus was about in-home voice assistants
   </p>

   <p>
     My first question was: do you or would you own an in-home voice assistant such as Google Home or Amazon Alexa?
   </p>

   <p>
     My next question was: do you think these devices are listening and recording
     what you say even before you say the activation word?
   </p>

   <p>
     My next question was: do you know who has access to all your data that is being stored?
   </p>

   <p>
     My last question was: is it ethical for these companies to always be recording with these devices?
   </p>
   <p>
     I polled thirty-three students at CSUEB. That sampling size is a little larger than a typical classroom
   </p>
   <p>
     A voice assistant is any device that has a voice activated interface
   </p>
   <p>
     A in-home voice assistant is a device that stays at home and is not mobile
   </p>
   <p>
     In the case of this project I took a look at in-home voice assistants, specifically from Google and Amazon
