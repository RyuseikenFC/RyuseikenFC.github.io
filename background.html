  Big companies like Amazon and Google have been known to have huge amounts of servers that collect tons of data.
</p>
<p>
  These companies are also known to keep big profiles on us based on input information from the past.
</p>
<p>
  Now that people have in-home assistants in their living spaces, the in-home assistants act as another input field for these companies.
</p>
<p>
  Typically for these devices to start listening and take an argument as a request, the user must say a specific activation word or phrase.

  CNN reported that an Amazon Alexa is being requested to be used as evidence in a
  murder case. A man is accused of killing another man while an Amazon Alexa was
  in the room. The Alexa was handed over as evidence but Amazon said they wouldn't
   release any recordings without a court order. The Alexa was owned by the man
   who committed the murder. To settle the case the owner of the Alexa consented
   to the recordings being released and Amazon released them.
